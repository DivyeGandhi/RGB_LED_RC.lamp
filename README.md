# RGB_LED_RC.lamp
I am very Excited to show you all that for the mini project of Electronics Design Workshop, I Created a Remote controlled RGB Lamp with tunable RGB and brightness to make 16,777,216 colours. It also has an Auto adjust to room Brightness button to adjust the brightness which best suits the room.
